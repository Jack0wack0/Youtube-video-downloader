# Youtube-video-downloader
This is a python script to download youtube videos in mp4 format for use in video editing.

I noticed awhile back that a lot of the websites for downloading youtube videos were super sketchy.
I decided to create my own python script using the pytube module in python. This works amazing.
I made this on MacOS so if you are using a windows machine you might not need the {ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_stdlib_context} thing.
Enjoy!
